# CS50 Lecture 0 - Computational Thinking & Scratch

- Computer Science is the process of solving problems and deciding how to represent data

- Binary operates in power of two, and operates on a similar design as base-10

- A bit represents a single expression of two binary digits (e.g. 01, 00 , or 11)

- A byte is 8 bits

- A transistor is a piece of hardware that our computers use to locally store information expressed in bytes or bits

- Characters other than digits are stored in binary notation as well, based on ASCII (e.g. 'A' is 65 in binary, or '01000001')

- Color is also represented in numbers (RGB)

- RGB can compose any color in the rainbow using three specified numbers

- An algorithm is simply step by step instructions to solve a problem
